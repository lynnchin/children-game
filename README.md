     Welcome to the irexchange Coding Exercise!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you can, please write a solution in a couple of different languages (say java and javascript) so that we can understand your proficiency in both.
 
Please share the solution through Github. Take as much time as you need. We perform these tests
to get a feel for how you approach problems, how you think, and how you design
your code.

Please do not share the test on social media (blogs facebook etc).

Thank you and have fun.

Consider the following children’s game:

* n children stand around a circle.
* Starting with a given child and working clockwise, each child gets a
sequential number, which we will refer to as it’s id.
* Then starting with the first child, they count out from 1 until k. The
k’th child is now out and leaves the circle. The count starts again
with the child immediately next to the eliminated one.
* Children are so removed from the circle one by one. The winner is the
child left standing last.

Write a method on a new class, which, when given n and k, returns the
sequence of children as they go out, and the id of the winning child. Create any
additional classes, tests, etc, you need to support the design of your solution.
 
Please document design decisions you have made i.e. general approach, where and why you have sacrificed performance for maintainability or visa versa etc.
